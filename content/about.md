Hi, I am Vallabh.

I am an engineer. I work on embedded automotive projects. I use C all the time and am flexible enough to learn python. 

This is my blog - The Siliconomist. I write about tech, science and any stuff that grabs my attention. I also have my trip photos in my gallery.

Currently this static site is hosted using hugo, using the ink-theme by knadh. I plan to improve the theme and add updates. 

Thank you 🙏
